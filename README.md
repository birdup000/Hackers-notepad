# Hacker's Notepad

Hacker's Notepad is a command-line application that simulates a hacker's text editor. It allows you to create and edit text files with a unique "hacking" aesthetic.

## Features

- Matrix-style rain animation on startup
- Customizable font styles and colors
- Ability to create and edit text files (`.txt`, `.log`, `.md`)
- Random "hacking" events (e.g., "Hacking into Mainframe...", "Updating Virus Database...")

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Colorama library (`pip install colorama`)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the script using the following command:

   ```
   python hacker_notepad.py
   ```

4. When prompted, enter the name of the file you want to create or edit (with a `.txt`, `.log`, or `.md` extension).
5. The program will display the file contents (if the file already exists) or create a new file.
6. You can then start typing and appending text to the file.
7. Enjoy the "hacking" experience with random events and the unique visual style!
